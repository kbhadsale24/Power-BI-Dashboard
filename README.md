# Power-BI-Dashboard

This Call Centre Analysis Dashboard provides a multi-faceted overview of a call center's performance metrics over a given period. Let me break down the key components for you:

Total Calls: The call center received a total of 33,000 calls.

Total Call Duration (mins): The cumulative time spent on calls is 824,000 minutes, which when converted to hours, is 14,000 hours. This suggests a high volume of lengthy calls or a large number of calls, or a combination of both.

Average Call Duration (mins): The average call duration is approximately 25 minutes, indicating that calls are relatively lengthy, possibly due to complex issues or detailed customer service processes.

Response Time %: The dashboard indicates a 75% response time percentage, which could mean that 75% of calls were answered within a target time frame. The specific definition of "response time %" would depend on the operational metrics of the call center.

Total Calls by Day: The bar graph displays the number of calls received each day of the week, showing an equal distribution of around 5,000 calls from Tuesday to Monday, with a noticeable dip on Sunday.

Total Calls by Reason: The calls are categorized by the reason for the call: Billing Questions, Payments, and Service Outages, each at 5,000 calls. This uniform distribution could indicate a common set of issues that customers are facing.

Total Calls by Channel: The pie chart illustrates the channels through which calls are received: Call-Center (11,000 calls), Chatbot (8,000 calls), Email (7,000 calls), and Web (7,000 calls). The call center channel is the most utilized, indicating a preference or necessity for customers to speak directly to a representative.

Total Calls by Call-Centres City: This bar graph shows the distribution of calls by the location of call centers: Los Angeles (13.7k), Baltimore (11k), Chicago (5.4k), and Denver (2.8k). This indicates the volume of calls handled by each city's call center.

Total Calls by Sentiment: The bar graph classifies calls by sentiment: Negative (11,000 calls), Very Negative (3.9k), Neutral (8.8k), Positive (6k), and Very Positive (3.2k). The sentiment analysis indicates that a significant number of calls are negative, which could be a point of concern for customer satisfaction.

Total Call Duration (line chart): The line chart shows a decline in total call duration from Friday to Sunday, suggesting that calls are shorter towards the weekend or that fewer calls are received.

From this dashboard, it is clear that while the call center is handling a large volume of calls across multiple channels, there is a significant proportion of negative sentiment, which may require attention to improve customer satisfaction. The high average call duration may also point towards a need for more efficient handling of calls or addressing complex issues that customers are encountering. The data suggests a consistent load throughout the week with a drop on Sundays, which could inform staffing and resource allocation strategies.
